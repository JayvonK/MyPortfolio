This is the repo for my portfolio website, it was made using next js, shadcn ui, tsparticles, tailwind css, and typescript. I aimed for a minimalistic design because I feel like I myself isn't a flashy or a standout person. So I wanted something minimal but not bland to help represent who I am as a developer.
